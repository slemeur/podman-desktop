# Installing the Podman Preset with OpenShift Local

On Windows, running the Podman container engine requires running a Linux distribution on a virtual machine.

Consider installing the Podman Preset in OpenShift Local rather than [installing Podman with Podman Desktop](installing-podman-with-podman-desktop) when you require one of following:

* No WSL 2
* Full control on the HyperV virtual machine
* User without administrator privileges
* VPN
* Windows 10

#### Prerequisites

* The user is a member of the *Hyper-V Administrators* group. The user can add a virtual machine, start or stop this virtual machine, and access the resources related to this virtual machine.
* Windows 10 version 1709 or later, Enterprise or Professional edition, or Windows 11, Enterprise or Professional edition

#### Procedure

1. [Install OpenShift Local](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local)

2. Select the Podman container runtime preset:

    ```
    $ crc config set preset podman
    ```

3. Set up your host machine for Red Hat OpenShift Local:

    ```
    $ crc setup
    ```

4. Start the Red Hat OpenShift instance:
    ```
    $ crc start
    ```
