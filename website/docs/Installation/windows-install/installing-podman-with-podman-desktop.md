# Installing Podman on Windows with Podman Desktop

On Windows, running the Podman container engine requires running a Linux distribution on a virtual machine.

Podman Desktop can assist you to install the Podman container engine in a Fedora distribution of Linux, on the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL 2).
Main benefits are:

* Ease of use
* Windows native virtualization performance


Consider rather [installing Podman with OpenShift Local](installing-podman-with-openshift-local) if:

* You prefer working with a RHEL distribution of Linux
* Your environment doesn't allow you to meet the prerequisites

#### Prerequisites

* 6 GB RAM
* No VPN
* [WSL prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed)
  * User with administrator privileges
  * Windows 64bit
  * Windows 10 Build 18362 or greater, or Windows 11
  * On a virtual machine: [Nested Virtualization enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization#configure-nested-virtualization)
* Podman is not installed
* No WSL 2 Linux virtual machine is running

#### Procedure

1. Enable the WSL feature without installing the default Ubuntu distribution of Linux. See [Enabling WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [WSL basic commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands):

    ```powershell
    wsl --install --no-distribution
    ```
   
2. The **Home** screen displays *Podman Desktop was not able to find an installation of Podman*. Click on **Install**.

2. Podman Desktop checks the prerequites to install Podman Engine. When necessary, follow the instructions to install prerequisites.

3. Podman displays the dialog: *Podman is not installed on this system, would you like to install Podman?*. Click on `Yes` to install Podman.

4. Click on **Initialize Podman**.
